# Voxel Annihilation

The galaxy teeters on the brink of chaos as the VOX Rebellion and the CUBE Empire engage in a conflict that shows no signs of ending.

The war has become a game of cat and mouse, with the VOX Rebellion relying on speed, strategy, and cunning to outmaneuver CUBE forces. Their units often exploit weaknesses in CUBE lines, targeting key infrastructure and supply chains to disrupt the enemy's ability to wage war.

CUBE, meanwhile, focuses on building a formidable foundation for its military might. Its units are designed to be durable and long-lasting, but their slow pace has allowed VOX to develop tactics that play to their strengths. The CUBE Empire struggles to adapt to the VOX Rebellion's more fluid and unpredictable approach.

Planets are scarred by the relentless barrage of laser fire and plasma strikes, their surfaces pockmarked with craters and debris. Moons hang silently in space, bearing witness to the devastation that has been wrought.

The conflict rages on, a never-ending cycle of competition between two opposing philosophies: CUBE's emphasis on brute strength and durability versus VOX's focus on speed, strategy, and adaptability. The galaxy is left to wonder which approach will ultimately prevail in this ongoing struggle for domination.

## VOX Rebellion

VOX units are more nimble and quick to build, but their lower armor and firepower render them less effective in direct combat.
